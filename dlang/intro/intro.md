# Introduction

D programming language is a general purpose [systems programming language] which belongs to the [C-family languages].
It is a rich programming language supporting multiple powerful [programming paradigms]; imperative, object-oriented, functional and meta-programming.
It is an expressive language integrating pragmatic features and making them cohesively elegant to write and understand.

The D programming language design goals has a tall order.
D combines competing requirements for efficiency, control, modeling power, safety and productivity.
D promotes the principle of make correct code easier to write and wrong code harder.

Here are several things to highlight from the D programming language.

* Modules
* Conditional Compilation
* Contract Programming
* Unit Testing
* Scope-Based RAII
* First Class Arrays
* Associative Arrays
* Dynamic Arrays
* Array slicing
* Nested Functions
* Inner Classes
* Closures
* Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)
* Compile-Time Function Execution
* Lazy Evaluation
* Mixins
* Inline Assembler

The D compiler have a few implementations. The reference compiler is called the Digital Mars D compiler or dmd.
[GDC] is based on GCC and [LDC] on LLVM. All compilers supports the i386 and amd64 architectures.^[1]
