I have decided to relearn the [_D Programming Language_](http://dlang.org/).
There has been a lot of new features and a ton of updates to the language since I last used it in 2006.
That's almost a decade of D development.
Looking at new features and updates at the change logs is exhaustingly a long but very interesting read.
D has come a long way.

To start relearning D, I think it would also be a good idea to write a [_Guide to the D Programming Language_](/dlang/index.html).
Writing this guide would definitely contribute to understanding the language better and I intend to share it.
I'm not sure how well I would do but I sure like the challenge.

Hopefully, the guide will evolve to become a good comprehensive reference learning the D programming language.
Who knows someone else might find it useful.
