NAME
====

git-symbolic-ref - Read, modify and delete symbolic refs

SYNOPSIS
========

    git symbolic-ref [-m <reason>] <name> <ref>
    git symbolic-ref [-q] [--short] <name>
    git symbolic-ref --delete [-q] <name>

DESCRIPTION
===========

Given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic ref refers to and outputs its path, relative to the `.git/` directory. Typically you would give `HEAD` as the &lt;name&gt; argument to see which branch your working tree is on.

Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref &lt;name&gt; to point at the given branch &lt;ref&gt;.

Given `--delete` and an additional argument, deletes the given symbolic ref.

A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins with `ref: refs/`. For example, your `.git/HEAD` is a regular file whose contents is `ref: refs/heads/master`.

OPTIONS
=======

`-d`; `--delete`

:   Delete the symbolic ref &lt;name&gt;.

`-q`; `--quiet`

:   Do not issue an error message if the &lt;name&gt; is not a symbolic ref but a detached HEAD; instead exit with non-zero status silently.

`--short`

:   When showing the value of &lt;name&gt; as a symbolic ref, try to shorten the value, e.g. from `refs/heads/master` to `master`.

`-m`

:   Update the reflog for &lt;name&gt; with &lt;reason&gt;. This is valid only when creating or updating a symbolic ref.

NOTES
=====

In the past, `.git/HEAD` was a symbolic link pointing at `refs/heads/master`. When we wanted to switch to another branch, we did `ln -sf refs/heads/newbranch .git/HEAD`, and when we wanted to find out which branch we are on, we did `readlink .git/HEAD`. But symbolic links are not entirely portable, so they are now deprecated and symbolic refs (as described above) are used by default.

*git symbolic-ref* will exit with status 0 if the contents of the symbolic ref were printed correctly, with status 1 if the requested name is not a symbolic ref, or 128 if another error occurs.
