I'm a programmer from the Philippines.
Did programming using some major programming languages, back-end programming in some major databases and did a few web front-ends too.
I like software engineering and I try to keep up with.

Nowadays, I'm doing a C++ project and (re)learning the D programming language.
I'm also trying to write a documentation for the D programming language.
Nothing much but I'd like to make as good as possible.
