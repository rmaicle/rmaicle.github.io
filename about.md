I'm a programmer from the Philippines.
Been exposed to different areas of software development as, i think, many of us do.
Did programming using some major programming languages, back-end programming in some major databases and did some web front-ends too.
Also keeping up with software engineering.

Accidentally came across GitHub Pages a few days ago and I hope this one fares better than my previous attempts.

Aside from all these, I like poetry (used to write some), music, history, science fiction, good laughs over a couple of cold, big mug of beer.
