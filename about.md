I have been proramming since my college days and still loving it.
As one who gets older, I started getting my exposures to different areas of software development.
I have used some major programming languages but I don't anymore.
Although I'm trying to learn a couple more.
I have done a few web development projects too but they're just a scratch.
Learning software engineering since 2000.
I still recall getting very excited with the strawman version.

I have heard about blogging back then but haven't really paid much attention.
I started creating blog accounts back in 2009 but I haven't really written anything worth sharing.
I tried blogging about software development since 2011 but all I have were a few posts.
I accidentally came across GitHub Pages a few days ago and now I'm here.
I hope it fares better this time.
