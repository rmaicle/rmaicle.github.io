I'm a programmer from the Philippines.
Been exposed to different areas of software development as, i think, many of us do.
Did programming using some major programming languages, back-end programming in some major databases and did some web front-ends too.
Also keeping up with software engineering. I still recall getting very excited back then with the strawman version.

Heard about blogging back then but haven't really paid much attention.
Started creating blog accounts back in 2009 but I haven't really written anything worth sharing.
Tried blogging about software development since 2011 but all I have were a few posts.
Accidentally came across GitHub Pages a few days ago and now I'm here.
I hope it fares better this time.

Aside from all these digital/electronic/computer stuff, I like poetry (used to write some), music, history, science fiction, good laughs and a couple of cold, big mug of beer (more is better, but don't expect me to do programming when I wake up).
