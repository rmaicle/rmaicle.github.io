I have been proramming since my college days and still loving it.
As one who gets older, I started getting my exposures to different areas of software development.
I have used different languages but I don't use the others much anymore; although I'm trying to learn a couple more.
I have done a few web development projects too but not that intensive; just a scratch.
I learned myself software engineering since 2000 and I still recall getting very excited with the strawman version.

I have heard about blogging back then but haven't really paid much attention.
I started creating blog accounts back in 2009 but I haven't really written anything worth sharing.
I tried blogging about software development since 2011 but all I have were a few posts.
Now, I got excited with GitHub Pages and I hope it fares better.
